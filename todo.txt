QUESTION
does our watcher have too much info?
i just realized that we shouldn't be able to see any door colors,
otherwise we can tell which one is the main door by process of elimination.
however the planning algorithm "knows" that which key can open intermediate doors.
i think we need to pretend that the knower can open any door with any key
